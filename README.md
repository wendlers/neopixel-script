NeoPixel Script - A DSL to drive NeoPixels
==========================================

This project tries to implement a simple DSL (domain specific language)
which easily allows to program effects for a NeoPixel based 8x8 matrix.
One of the main goals of this language is to be simple and easy to learn
and understand especially for children. Thus, the language is offered in
different languages (currently german and english). A simple script which
will produce a colerful effect on the whole 8x8 matrix would look like
this:

In german

    wiederhole 8 mal
      // "schiebt" 2 gr√ºne Pixel von der linken Seite ein
      schiebe 2 links in gruen
      warte 100 msek
      schiebe 2 links in rot
      warte 100 msek
      schiebe 2 links in lila
      warte 100 msek
      schiebe 2 links in weiss
      warte 100 msek
    ende

And in englisch

    repeat 8 times
      // "shifts" in 2 green pixels from the left side
      shift 2 left in green
      sleep 100 msec
      shift 2 left in red
      sleep 100 msec
      shift 2 left in magenta
      sleep 100 msec
      shift 2 left in white
      sleep 100 msec
    end

For more examples see the "examples" directory.

How it works
------------

LED effects are written in NPS (NeoPixel Sript). Then the NPS is "compiled"
into C++ code (by a Python tool). The C++ code is linked with some Arduino
libraries (especially FastLED) into an native executable for the Arduino,
and then uploaded.

By using PlatformIO IDE, the steps described above are as easy as editing
"effects_de.nps" if using the german implementation of NPS or "effects_en.nps"
if using the englisch implementation. Then the only thing left to do is hit
the "Upload" button on the left, and after a few seconds, the Arduino will run
your script.

Usage
-----

You need PlatformIO IDE (CLI will also do but is more complex to install).
To install PlatformIO IDE, follow the [steps described on their webside](
  http://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/installation.html).

Then open the IDE by starting "Atom" and choose "Open Project" and point it to
the "neopixel-script" directory.
Edit "npscript.ini". You need to specify the language of NPS, and the name of
your script file (default language is "en", and default script is "effects_en.nps").
The data input of the NeoPixel matrix needs to be connected to PIN3. The
default MCU is "pro16MHzatmega328". If yours is different, specify in "platformio.ini".
